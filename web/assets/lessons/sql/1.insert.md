# Populating our Database

The first thing we've got to learn how to do is add data to our database.

## Add a new row/record

Creating records/rows in our database is accomplished using `INSERT INTO`.

To add a new employee to the employees table for example, use the following:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
            (name,
             surname,
             hire_date)
VALUES      ('Loi',
             'Tran',
             Date('now'))
```

## Insert multiple rows/records

We can `INSERT INTO` multiple records relatively easily as well.

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
            (name,
             surname,
             hire_date,
             email)
VALUES      ('Charles',
             'Do',
             Date('now'),
             'charles@seepdeep.com'),
            ('Michael',
             'Lee',
             Date('now'),
             'michael@seepdeep.com'),
            --- continued...
```
