- Exposure to a larger audience
- CS Partner Program
  Medium’s Partner Program is for people who are interested in helping us fulfill our mission of deepening the collective wisdom of the world through personal expression, knowledge-sharing, and storytelling.
  - Quality over AI Regurgitation
    In a creator economy ruled by clickbait and ad impressions, Medium’s Partner Program is taking a stand for quality. As a partner, when your best stories are read by Medium members, a portion of their membership dues will be shared with you. Here are a few factors we consider in order to determine quality.
  - How are Earnings Calculated?
    Earnings will be based on member read and listen time as well as member engagement signals. This includes claps, highlights, replies, and new follows. Reads and read ratios will be defined as people who read your story for 30 seconds or more divided by total views. More information on how earnings are calculated can be found here with examples featured here.
  - Where can I go if I have more questions?
