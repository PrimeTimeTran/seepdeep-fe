### React Native Mastery Projects:

1. **Advanced UI Components**: Build more complex UI components like sliders, tabs, accordions, and animated buttons to enhance the user experience of your React Native app.

2. **Advanced Navigation**: Implement advanced navigation patterns like nested navigators, tab navigation, and drawer navigation using React Navigation. Learn how to handle deep linking and navigation events.

3. **State Management with Redux or Context**: Integrate Redux or React Context for state management in large-scale React Native apps. Learn how to centralize state, manage complex data flows, and optimize performance.

4. **Advanced API Integration**: Integrate with more complex APIs such as GraphQL APIs or APIs that require authentication. Learn how to handle authentication tokens, pagination, and error handling in API requests.

5. **Push Notifications**: Implement push notifications in your React Native app using services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). Learn how to send and receive push notifications and handle user interactions.

6. **Geolocation and Maps Integration**: Integrate geolocation and maps functionality into your React Native app using libraries like react-native-maps. Learn how to display maps, add markers, and track user location.

7. **Offline Support and Syncing**: Implement offline support and data syncing in your React Native app using libraries like Redux Offline or custom solutions. Learn how to cache data locally and synchronize changes with the server.

8. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the performance of your React Native app by reducing bundle size, optimizing rendering performance, lazy loading components, and implementing code-splitting techniques.

9. **Testing**: Set up testing frameworks like Jest and React Native Testing Library for unit testing and integration testing of your React Native components and features. Learn how to write test cases and automate testing workflows.

10. **Deployment and Continuous Integration**: Deploy your React Native app to app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store) and set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using services like Bitrise or Fastlane.

These projects will help you build a strong foundation in React Native development and advance your skills to mastery level. Experiment with different project ideas, explore new libraries and techniques, and contribute to open-source projects to further enhance your React Native skills.
