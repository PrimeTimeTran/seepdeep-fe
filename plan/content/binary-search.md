The 20 Questions game showed us the power of divide-and-conquer algorithms that split groups in half. Binary search is an algorithm that builds off of this idea to very quickly locate the desired number in a range of numbers.

Binary search is a fundamental tool in the toolbox of any computer scientist. It is also a great example of the divide-and-conquer strategy. Splitting problems in half to solve them more quickly is a concept that appears over and over again in computer science.

Number guessing game

1,2,3,4, ... 1,000,000

Really bad algorithm

What would be better would be to divide the problem space in half.

500,000, lower or higher?

3..3 means max 1 guess

1..3 means max 2 guesses

1..5 means max 4 guesses

1..200,000 would be 18
