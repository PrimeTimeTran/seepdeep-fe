## Intro

### `FILTER`ing:

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows based on a specified condition. For example, `SELECT` name, age `FROM` employees `WHERE` age > 30 retrieves rows `FROM` the employees table `WHERE` the age column is greater than 30.

### Multiple Conditions with `AND` & `OR`:

You can use logical operators such as `AND` & `OR` to combine multiple conditions. For example, `SELECT` name, age `FROM` employees `WHERE` age > 30 `AND` department = 'Sales' retrieves rows `WHERE` age is greater than 30 `AND` the department is 'Sales'.

### Using Comparison Operators:

The `WHERE` clause supports various comparison operators such as =, <>, >, <, >=, `AND` <=. For example, `SELECT` name `FROM` employees `WHERE` department <> 'Sales' retrieves employees not in the Sales department.

### Pattern Matching with LIKE:

The `LIKE` operator allows for pattern matching in string columns. For example, `SELECT` name `FROM` employees `WHERE` name `LIKE` 'J%' retrieves employees whose names start with 'J'.

### NULL Handling with `IS NULL` & `IS NOT NULL`:

You can use `IS NULL` & `IS NOT NULL` to filter rows based on whether a column is or isn't null. For example, `SELECT` name `FROM` employees `WHERE` manager_id `IS NULL` retrieves employees who do not have a manager.
