## Intro

Aggregate functions in SQL are functions that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. They are commonly used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to group rows based on specified criteria. Here are the top five aggregate functions in SQL with examples:

### `COUNT`:

The `COUNT` function returns the number of rows in a set. It can be used with an asterisk (\*) to `COUNT` all rows or with a specific column to `COUNT` non-null values in that column.
Example:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### `SUM`:

The `SUM` function calculates the total sum of values in a numeric column.
Example:

```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### `AVG`:

The `AVG` function calculates the average of values in a numeric column.
Example:

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### `MAX`:

The `MAX` function returns the maximum value in a column.
Example:

```sql
SELECT department, MAX(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### MIN:

The MIN function returns the minimum value in a column.
Example:

```sql
SELECT department, MIN(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
