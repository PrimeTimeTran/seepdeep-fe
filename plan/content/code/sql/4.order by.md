## Intro

When working with SQL, understanding how to sort data using the `ORDER BY` clause is essential. Here are the top 5 things to know about using the `ORDER BY` clause in SQL:

### Basic Sorting:

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the rows in your result set based on one or more columns. By default, the rows are sorted in ascending order. For example, `SELECT` name, age `FROM` employees `ORDER BY` age sorts employees by age in ascending order.

### `DESC`ending Order:

You can specify `DESC`ending order using the `DESC` keyword. For example, `SELECT` name, age `FROM` employees `ORDER BY` age `DESC` sorts employees by age in `DESC`ending order.

### Sorting by Multiple Columns:

You can sort by multiple columns, with sorting priorities determined by the order you list the columns. For example, `SELECT` name, age `FROM` employees `ORDER BY` department, age sorts employees first by department in ascending order and then by age within each department.

### Sorting by Column Alias:

If you use an alias for a column in your `SELECT` statement, you can also use it in the `ORDER BY` clause. For example, `SELECT` name, age AS years `FROM` employees `ORDER BY` years sorts the result set by the age alias (years).

### Case Sensitivity and Collation:

Sorting can be affected by the case sensitivity and collation settings of the database. For example, in some databases, 'A' and 'a' are considered different characters when sorting, while in others, they are considered equal. Be mindful of your database's specific settings when sorting.
