To become an introductory-level Node.js developer, you should focus on understanding the core concepts and tools commonly used in Node.js development. Here are the top 10 things you should know:

1. **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals including variables, data types, functions, scope, closures, and asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await).

2. **Node.js Basics**: Understanding of what Node.js is, its architecture, event-driven nature, and how it differs from traditional server-side environments like PHP or Python.

3. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Familiarity with npm, the default package manager for Node.js. Learn how to use npm to install, manage, and publish packages/modules, as well as how to create and manage `package.json` files.

4. **Express.js**: Basic knowledge of Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. Learn how to create routes, handle HTTP requests and responses, serve static files, and work with middleware.

5. **Asynchronous Programming**: Deep understanding of asynchronous programming in Node.js using callbacks, promises, and async/await. Learn how to handle asynchronous operations effectively to avoid blocking the event loop.

6. **HTTP Module**: Understanding of Node.js's built-in HTTP module for creating HTTP servers and handling HTTP requests and responses. Learn how to create a basic HTTP server and handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

7. **File System Module (fs)**: Familiarity with the built-in fs module for working with the file system in Node.js. Learn how to read/write files, create directories, and handle file-related operations asynchronously.

8. **Debugging and Logging**: Knowledge of debugging techniques and logging practices in Node.js. Learn how to use tools like `console.log`, `debugger`, and debugging tools in IDEs (e.g., VS Code) to troubleshoot issues in your code.

9. **Basic CRUD Operations with Databases**: Understanding of how to connect and interact with databases from Node.js. Start with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using libraries like `mysql`, `mongodb`, or `sequelize` (for SQL databases).

10. **RESTful APIs**: Understanding of RESTful principles and how to design and implement RESTful APIs in Node.js using Express.js. Learn how to define routes, handle different HTTP methods, and structure API endpoints.

By mastering these foundational concepts and tools, you'll be well-equipped to start building simple web applications and APIs with Node.js. As you gain more experience, you can explore more advanced topics and frameworks to further enhance your skills.
