      "answer": "",
      "explanation": "All that we're really being asked to do here is to maximize the profit subject to the constraint that x must be in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 250.\nFirst, we'll need the derivative and the critical point(s) that fall in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 250.\nP'(x)=-16x+3200⇒3200-16x=0,⇒x=320016=200\nSince the profit function is continuous and we have an interval with finite bounds we can find the maximum value by simply plugging in the only critical point that we have (which nicely enough in the range of acceptable answers) and the end points of the range.\nP(0)=-80,000P(200)=240,000P(250)=220,000\n\nSo, it looks like they will generate the most profit if they only rent out 200 of the apartments instead of all 250 of them."

      "answer": "",
      "explanation": "Here we need to minimize the cost subject to the constraint that x must be in the range  0≤x≤60,000\n. Note that in this case the cost function is not continuous at the left endpoint and so we won't be able to just plug critical points and endpoints into the cost function to find the minimum value.\n\nLet's get the first couple of derivatives of the cost function.\n\nC′(x)=0.08−200,000,000x2C′′(x)=400,000,000x3\nThe critical points of the cost function are,\n\n0.08−200,000,000x2=00.08x2=200,000,000x2=2,500,000,000⇒x=±√2,500,000,000=±50,000\n\nNow, clearly the negative value doesn't make any sense in this setting and so we have a single critical point in the range of possible solutions : 50,000.\n\nNow, as long as x > 0 the second derivative is positive and so, in the range of possible solutions the function is always concave up and so producing 50,000 widgets will yield the absolute minimum production cost.\n\nRecall from the Optimization section we discussed how we can use the second derivative to identity the absolute extrema even though all we really get from it is relative extrema."
