# Windows

A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.

## Update all employees IDs

Window functions are advanced but elegant. In this case we're updating all our employee ids to be sequential.

```sql
CREATE temp TABLE temp_employees AS
  SELECT employee_id,
         Row_number() over (ORDER BY employee_id) AS new_employee_id FROM
employees;

UPDATE employees
SET    employee_id = (SELECT new_employee_id
                      FROM   temp_employees
                      WHERE  temp_employees.employee_id = employees.employee_id);

DROP TABLE temp_employees;
```
