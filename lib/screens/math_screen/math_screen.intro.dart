The limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a value  c represents the value  f(x) approaches as x gets arbitrarily close to c. Key properties, like sum, difference, constant multiple, product, and quotient properties, aid in evaluating limits efficiently. Techniques such as direct substitution and L'HÃ´pital's Rule help determine limits in various scenarios. Understanding limits is essential as they form the basis for concepts like continuity, derivatives, and integrals, enabling the analysis of functions' behavior near critical points.",

Key properties, such as the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule, allow for the differentiation of various functions efficiently. Techniques like implicit differentiation and logarithmic differentiation expand the scope of functions that can be differentiated. Understanding derivatives is fundamental as they provide insights into the behavior of functions, including identifying extrema, inflection points, and graph characteristics. They also have applications in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields where rates of change are essential for analysis.",
